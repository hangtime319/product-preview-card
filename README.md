# Product Preview Card

A responsive, single-component product preview card, built with pure HTML and CSS.

## Description

This project is a solution to the "Product preview card" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The main objective was to create a clean and modern component with a key focus on **responsive design**. This project is a great exercise in mastering foundational web development skills, as it achieves a two-column layout on desktop and a vertical layout on mobile using pure **HTML and CSS**, without the need for JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For creating the semantic structure of the card, including the product image, title, description, price, and the button.
* **CSS3:** This is the sole technology for all the styling. It was used to create the responsive layout, handle typography, and ensure the card looks great on all screen sizes, including a responsive image that changes based on the device.

## Usage

This project serves as a showcase of a clean, single-component design. It displays all the necessary information for a product and is ready to be integrated into any e-commerce page or product listing. It's a great example of what can be accomplished with foundational web technologies.

## Features

* **Responsive Layout:** The card transitions smoothly from a horizontal layout on desktop to a vertical layout on mobile.
* **Responsive Image:** The product image also changes to a mobile-optimized version on smaller screens.
* **Clean & Modern UI:** The design is simple, professional, and visually appealing, with a clear focus on readability.
